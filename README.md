# coffee-shop-analysis

In this project, I analyzed and visualized the data owned by a coffee shop for 8 months in the same year using Tableau. The data I analyzed included revenue, sold products, payment types, and order types each month.

Both the Tableau Project and the dataset that can be accessed have been provided in this repository.
Tableau public = https://public.tableau.com/shared/5CJ2PTQ2H?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

Some columns in Bahasa:
1. tanggal_transaksi = transaction date
2. nama_produk = product name
3. jenis_produk = product type
4. kategori_produk = product category
5. harga_jual = price
6. jenis_pembayaran = payment method
7. jenis_pesanan = order type
8. nilai_penjualan = revenue

Thank you to BIMA PUTRA for creating the dataset that can be used for this program. https://lynk.id/bima.putra1/vqwe5Rm

This project is a simple project that still has many shortcomings, but I hope it can be useful. Thank you for coming.
