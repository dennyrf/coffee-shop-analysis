# coffee-shop-analysis

In this project, I analyzed and visualized the data owned by a coffee shop for 8 months in the same year using Tableau. The data I analyzed included revenue, sold products, payment types, and order types each month.

Both the Tableau Project and the dataset that can be accessed have been provided in this repository.

Some columns in Bahasa:
tanggal_transaksi = transaction date
nama_produk = product name
jenis_produk = product type
kategori_produk = product category
harga_jual = price
jenis_pembayaran = payment method
jenis_pesanan = order type
nilai_penjualan = revenue

Thank you to BIMA PUTRA for creating the dataset that can be used for this program. https://lynk.id/bima.putra1/vqwe5Rm

This project is a simple project that still has many shortcomings, but I hope it can be useful. Thank you for coming.
